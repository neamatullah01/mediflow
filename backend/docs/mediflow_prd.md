## 1. Project Overview

**Name:** MediFlow  
**Tagline:** The AI-Powered Smart Pharmacy Management Platform  
**Problem it solves:**

Pharmacies in developing countries (Bangladesh and globally) struggle with:

- Drug stockouts — popular medicines run out with no warning
- Expiry waste — medicines expire on shelves, costing thousands
- Drug interaction errors — pharmacists miss dangerous drug combinations
- Manual, paper-based workflows — no digital tracking of inventory or prescriptions

**MediFlow** replaces spreadsheets and paper notebooks with a full-stack, AI-powered platform that gives pharmacies real-time inventory control, AI-driven safety checks, automated supplier order management, and clinical decision support — all in one web application.

**Who uses it:**

- **Pharmacist (user role):** Day-to-day medicine dispensing, inventory, prescriptions
- **Admin:** Platform-level management — all pharmacies, all users, drug master database, analytics

## 6. AI Features (4 Required)

> All AI features use **Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash)** — free tier.  
> All must handle loading state, error handling, and structured JSON output.

---

### AI Feature 1: Drug Interaction Checker

**Where:** `/dashboard/interactions` — standalone utility page

**How it works:**

1. User enters 2–5 drug names in input fields (tag input)
2. Frontend sends `POST /api/v1/ai/check-interactions` with `{ drugs: ["Warfarin", "Aspirin", "Metformin"] }`
3. Backend validates pharmacist's `pharmacyId` from session
4. Backend builds a structured prompt and calls Gemini API
5. Response parsed as JSON and saved to `DrugInteractionCheck` table (linked to pharmacy)
6. Frontend displays color-coded result cards

**Prompt template:**

```
You are an expert clinical pharmacist. Analyze the following drug combination for interactions:
Drugs: {drug_list}

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format with no extra text:
{
  "overall_risk": "safe|moderate|dangerous",
  "summary": "One sentence overall assessment",
  "pairs": [
    {
      "drug_a": "Drug name",
      "drug_b": "Drug name",
      "severity": "safe|moderate|dangerous",
      "reason": "Clinical explanation (max 2 sentences)",
      "recommendation": "What the pharmacist should do"
    }
  ],
  "disclaimer": "Standard medical disclaimer"
}
```

**UI Result:**

- Overall risk badge (green/amber/red)
- One card per drug pair showing severity + reason + recommendation
- "Run New Check" button to perform another analysis

---

### AI Feature 2: AI Demand Forecasting

**Where:** `/dashboard/inventory` → top banner "AI Forecast" + dedicated `/dashboard/inventory/forecast` page

**How it works:**

1. Backend aggregates last 30 days of dispensing logs per drug for this pharmacy
2. Pharmacist clicks "Generate Forecast"
3. Frontend sends `POST /api/v1/ai/demand-forecast` with `{ pharmacyId }`
4. Backend fetches dispensing data, formats it, calls Gemini API
5. Returns forecast JSON with urgency levels
6. Result cached for 6 hours (Redis / node-cache) to avoid repeated API calls

**Prompt template:**

```
You are a pharmacy inventory analyst. Analyze this 30-day sales data and forecast stock needs.

Sales data (last 30 days):
{sales_data_formatted_as_list}

Current stock levels:
{current_stock_formatted_as_list}

For each drug, predict if it will stock out in the next 14 days.
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "generated_at": "ISO date string",
  "forecasts": [
    {
      "drug_name": "...",
      "current_stock": 45,
      "avg_daily_usage": 4.0,
      "days_until_empty": 11,
      "will_stockout_in_14_days": true,
      "suggested_order_qty": 150,
      "urgency": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "reasoning": "Short explanation"
    }
  ],
  "overall_insight": "2-3 sentence summary of inventory health"
}
```

**UI Result:**

- Summary card with overall_insight from AI
- Sorted table by urgency (critical first)
- Each row: drug name, days until empty, urgency badge, suggested order qty, "Create Order" shortcut button
- "Export Forecast as PDF" button

---

### AI Feature 3: AI Pharmacist Assistant (Chatbot)

**Where:** `/dashboard/ai-assistant` — dedicated full-page chat interface

**How it works:**

1. Pharmacist types a clinical question (dosage, substitution, side effects, etc.)
2. Frontend sends `POST /api/v1/ai/chat` with `{ messages: [...conversationHistory], newMessage: "..." }`
3. Backend maintains conversation context by passing full history to Gemini
4. Gemini streaming response piped back to frontend via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
5. Chat history saved to DB (`AiChatSession`, `AiChatMessage` tables)

**System prompt (sent once as first message):**

```
You are MediBot, an expert clinical pharmacist assistant built into the MediFlow platform.
You help pharmacists with:
- Drug dosage questions (adult and pediatric)
- Drug substitution recommendations
- Side effect information
- Contraindications and warnings
- Storage and handling requirements
- General pharmaceutical knowledge

Always be clear, concise, and professional. Always end responses with:
"⚠️ For patient-specific decisions, always consult the prescribing physician."
Never diagnose patients or replace medical advice.
```

**UI:**

- Left sidebar: list of past chat sessions with first message preview, "New Chat" button
- Main area: chat bubbles (user right, MediBot left)
- Typing indicator (animated dots) while streaming
- Each AI message has "Copy" button
- Input with send button + Enter key support
- Streaming: words appear one by one (not all at once)

---

### AI Feature 4: AI Auto Drug Tagger & Categorizer

**Where:** `/admin/drugs` → "Add Drug" form → "Auto-fill with AI" button  
**Also:** Admin can run batch re-categorization on existing drugs

**Why this replaces Prescription Reader:** Prescription reader needs image understanding from a paid/advanced API tier. The Auto Tagger works perfectly with Gemini's free tier and is genuinely useful — it lets admin add a drug name and Gemini fills in all other fields automatically.

**How it works:**

1. Admin types only the drug name (e.g., "Amoxicillin 500mg")
2. Clicks "Auto-fill with AI"
3. Frontend sends `POST /api/v1/ai/tag-drug` with `{ drugName: "Amoxicillin 500mg" }`
4. Backend calls Gemini API with structured prompt
5. Returns full drug profile as JSON
6. Form fields are pre-filled with AI output — admin can review and edit before saving

**Prompt template:**

```
You are a pharmaceutical database expert. Given a drug name, provide complete structured information.

Drug name: {drug_name}

Return ONLY valid JSON with no extra text:
{
  "name": "Full brand/generic name",
  "generic_name": "INN generic name",
  "category": "One of: Antibiotic|Analgesic|Antidiabetic|Cardiovascular|Vitamin|Respiratory|Antifungal|Antiviral|Antihistamine|Gastrointestinal|Psychiatric|Other",
  "dosage_form": "One of: tablet|capsule|syrup|injection|cream|inhaler|drops",
  "description": "2-3 sentence plain-language description of what this drug is and its primary use",
  "uses": ["Use 1", "Use 2", "Use 3"],
  "common_dosage": "Standard adult dosage guidance",
  "side_effects": ["Side effect 1", "Side effect 2", "Side effect 3"],
  "contraindications": ["Contraindication 1", "Contraindication 2"],
  "storage": "Storage requirements (e.g. Store below 25°C, away from light)",
  "manufacturer": "Common manufacturer name (or 'Various' if generic)"
}
```

**UI:**

- Drug form initially has only "Drug Name" filled in
- "Auto-fill with AI" button with loading spinner
- On success: all other fields populate instantly with smooth fade-in animation
- Admin reviews, edits anything incorrect, then saves
- Error state if AI fails: "Could not auto-fill. Please enter details manually."

## 10. Advanced Engineering Requirements

### Frontend (3 required — we implement all 5)

| Requirement          | Implementation                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server Components    | Drug list, drug detail, blog pages — fetched server-side with Next.js RSC                                           |
| Suspense / Streaming | Wrap dashboard charts and drug detail sections in `<Suspense>` with skeleton fallbacks                              |
| Optimistic UI        | Adding inventory item — show it in the table immediately, rollback if API fails                                     |
| Live notifications   | Socket.io broadcasts low-stock alert to logged-in pharmacist in real time when another dispensing event triggers it |
| Real-time updates    | AI chat streaming via SSE — responses stream word by word                                                           |

### Backend (3 required — we implement all 5)

| Requirement    | Implementation                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rate limiting  | `express-rate-limit`: global 100 req/15min, AI endpoints 10 req/15min                                          |
| Logging        | Winston: info level to console, error level to `logs/error.log`, requests logged via morgan                    |
| Caching        | `node-cache`: AI forecast response cached per pharmacyId for 6 hours                                           |
| Queue system   | BullMQ: daily job runs at midnight to check all inventory items for low stock + expiry, emits Socket.io events |
| Error tracking | All caught errors logged to file; production: integrate Sentry DSN                                             |

## 11. UI & Design Rules

### Color Palette (max 3 primary + neutral)

| Token     | Color                | Usage                                                |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary   | `#0EA5E9` (sky blue) | Buttons, links, active states                        |
| Secondary | `#10B981` (emerald)  | Success states, "safe" interactions, in-stock badges |
| Accent    | `#F59E0B` (amber)    | Warnings, low stock, moderate severity               |
| Danger    | `#EF4444` (red)      | Errors, dangerous interactions, out of stock         |
| Neutral   | Gray scale           | Text, backgrounds, borders                           |

### Global Rules

- Light mode default, dark mode via `class="dark"` toggle stored in localStorage
- All cards: same border radius (`rounded-xl` / `12px`), same padding (`p-5`)
- All cards: `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700` with white/gray-900 background
- Spacing system: multiples of 4px using Tailwind (gap-4, p-5, mt-6, etc.)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts) — weights 400, 500, 600
- All forms: React Hook Form + Zod — show error messages below each field, success toast on submit
- Skeleton loaders on all data-fetched sections
- No lorem ipsum anywhere — all content is real pharma domain content

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint          | Cards per row |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| Mobile (<768px)     | 1             |
| Tablet (768–1024px) | 2             |
| Desktop (>1024px)   | 4             |

## 12. Environment Variables

### Backend `.env`

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/mediflow

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret_here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Google Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# File Storage — Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Redis (optional — fallback to node-cache if not set)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# BullMQ
BULL_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Sentry (production)
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Frontend `.env.local`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Better Auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Google OAuth (used by Better Auth)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

## 13. Response Format

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Inventory items retrieved successfully",
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 87,
    "totalPages": 5
  },
  "data": []
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errorSources": [
    { "path": "quantity", "message": "Quantity must be a positive number" },
    { "path": "expiryDate", "message": "Expiry date cannot be in the past" }
  ],
  "stack": "..."
}
```

> `stack` is only included when `NODE_ENV=development`

---

## 14. Business Logic Rules

1. **Registration:** Better Auth hashes password internally before storing. Auto-create `Pharmacy` record linked to new `User`.
2. **Login:** Better Auth verifies credentials → creates a session stored in DB → sets HTTP-only session cookie automatically.
3. **Auth Middleware:** Better Auth validates session cookie → check user exists in DB → confirm `isBanned = false` → validate role via Better Auth plugin.
4. **Inventory Status Auto-update:** On every inventory update, recalculate `status`:
   - `quantity === 0` → `OUT_OF_STOCK`
   - `quantity <= reorderLevel` → `LOW_STOCK`
   - `expiryDate < today` → `EXPIRED`
   - else → `IN_STOCK`
5. **Dispensing Event:** Deduct `quantityDispensed` from `InventoryItem.quantity`. If resulting quantity ≤ reorder level, emit Socket.io event `low-stock-alert` to connected pharmacist.
6. **Order Received:** On status change to `RECEIVED`, loop through all `OrderLineItem`s and increment corresponding `InventoryItem.quantity`. If no matching `InventoryItem` exists, create one.
7. **AI Rate Limit:** AI endpoints limited to 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP to protect free API quota.
8. **AI Forecast Cache:** Cache forecast result per `pharmacyId` for 6 hours in node-cache. Return cached result if available and not expired.
9. **Drug Interaction Save:** Each call to `/ai/check-interactions` saves a `DrugInteractionCheck` record to DB regardless of result — for audit trail.
10. **Chat History:** Full conversation history passed to Gemini on every message to maintain context. Session title auto-set to first user message (max 50 chars).
11. **Drug Review Uniqueness:** One review per pharmacist per drug. Enforce with `@@unique([drugId, pharmacistId])`.
12. **Pagination:** All list endpoints support `?page=1&limit=20&sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc`.
13. **Search:** All search uses Prisma `contains` with `mode: 'insensitive'` for case-insensitive matching.
14. **Admin Seeding:** Admin user created via `prisma/seed.ts` — never through registration endpoint.
15. **Blog Slug:** Auto-generated from title on creation using slugify. Must be unique.

## 15. Deployment Checklist

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in all environments
2. Provision PostgreSQL on **Neon** (free tier — 512MB)
3. Run `npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. Run `npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts` to seed admin + sample drugs
5. Configure **Cloudinary** account and set env vars
6. Get **Gemini API key** from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) — free
7. Configure **Google OAuth** credentials in Google Cloud Console and register them in Better Auth config
8. Set CORS to allow frontend domain only in production
9. Deploy backend to **Railway** (free tier)
10. Deploy frontend to **Vercel** (free tier)
11. Set all env vars in Railway and Vercel dashboards — never hardcode
12. Test all 4 AI features with real API calls in production
13. Verify dark mode contrast on all pages
14. Verify all 4 cards per row on desktop view
15. Confirm demo login buttons work with seeded credentials

## 16. Demo Credentials

| Role       | Email                     | Password     |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Pharmacist | `pharmacist@mediflow.com` | `Demo@1234`  |
| Admin      | `admin@mediflow.com`      | `Admin@1234` |

Both accounts seeded via `prisma/seed.ts` with realistic sample data:

- 50 drugs in master catalogue
- 30 inventory items for demo pharmacy
- 15 dispensing logs (last 30 days) for chart data
- 5 supplier orders in various statuses
- 5 interaction checks in history
- 10 blog posts (published)
- 5 AI chat sessions with message history
